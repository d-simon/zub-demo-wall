#Zürich unbezahlbar – Demo Wall 
A little tool to explore different color schemes and patterns for the upcoming site "Zürich unbezahlbar"

**Important:** file:// protocol does not work, since the tool uses an object-to-inline-svg replacement technique.
You either need to [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) the index.html locally or host it somewhere.
